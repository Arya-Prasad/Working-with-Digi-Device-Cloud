Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) have been considered as a promising technology
for smart metering applications due to its rapid self-organizing and superior
coordinating ability to integrate sensing, computing and communication into a
single low-power low-cost system. The usage data gathered from smart meters
located in end user premises provides a valuable resource that can be used by the
utilities to implement adaptive pricing and demand response applications.

In this project, a communication framework for NAN based on wireless sensor
networks was presented. An experimental model of the network was developed using
open source Arduino Platform for data aggregation and Digi XBee RF modules for
data communication. A system of nodes collect data from different clusters of smart
meters and relay the data to a central gateway which is stored in Digi Device Cloud
data streams. A Python script was also written to demonstrate that the data is
available for local and remote access through standard HTTP requests to the Device
Cloud Server. This prototype implementation can be used as a model to build other
smart metering utility networks.
